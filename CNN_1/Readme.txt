The program "Figure_CNN" generates Figure 4 from the manuscript, which compares three strategies for a CNN benchmark problem. Moreover, it generates data input into Table III and subsection IIIC of the manuscript. It does so based on files of the form "values_..." that contain detailed results of this test for various strategies and numbers of dimensions and sampled points in a pickled format.
