The program "Figure_generic" generates Figure 2 from the manuscript, which compares three strategies for a generic function benchmark problem. Moreover, it generates data input into Table I, Table IV, and subsection IIIA of the manuscript. It does so based on files of the form "Hyperuniform_...," "Random_...," "Numbers_...," and "Scores_..."  that contain detailed results of this test for various strategies and numbers of dimensions and sampled points in a pickled format.

The latter files were generated by the programs "Generic_generate_results," "Generic_generate_results_hyper," "Generic_generate_results_quasi," and "Generic_generate_results_random." 

Files of the form "Data_trials_..." contain parameters of the function used in different trials (generated using the "Generic_generate_results" program). These files were used to verify each strategy on the same set of generic functions.
