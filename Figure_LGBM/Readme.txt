The program "Figure_LGBM" generates Figure 3 from the manuscript, which compares three strategies for a LightGBM benchmark problem. Moreover, it generates data input into Table II and subsection IIIB of the manuscript. It does so based on files of the form "..._combined" and "data_files..." that contain detailed results of this test for various strategies and numbers of dimensions and sampled points in a pickled format.
